## cd Command
<br/>
NO ARGUMENTS

### Input/Output


```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ 
```

**Working Directory:** Home
 <br/>
 <br/>
**Explanation:** The following output occurred because of the fact that cd stands for change directory, however, since there was no argument, there was no directory to change to. Thus, the code essentially did nothing as it had no directory to take us to.
<br/>
<br/>
This output is NOT an error
<br/>
***
DIRECTORY AS ARGUMENT

### Input/Output

```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$
```

**Working Directory:** lecture1
<br/>
<br/>
**Explanation:** This time, there was a directory provided. As a result, Java took us to the given directory with the cd command. This can be seen as the resulting line in ther terminal has "/lecture1" inbetween the brackets to indicate to us that we are now working in the directory of lecture1.
<br/>
<br/>
This output is NOT an error
